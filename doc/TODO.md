## Refactor!
- [ ] implement `ChainMaker`
- [ ] inherit from `ChainMaker`
    - [ ] so lose `Collectable`
- [ ] implement `Transmitter`
- [ ] inherit from `Transmitter`
- [ ] implement everything through `addListener()`

### make it useful
- [ ] refactor Collection piped calls
    - [ ] `render` should return `this`
    - [ ] `write` should return `this`
- [ ] refactor ChoppingBoard piped calls
    - [ ] `render` should return `this`
    - [ ] `write` should return `this`
- [ ] render collections themselves
- [ ] group pages/collections by template, re-render on template update

### make it right
- [ ] types/interfaces/modules
- [ ] unit tests (Jest?)
    - [ ] `Transmitter` and all descendants should pass unrecognized events along untouched and unhindered
- [ ] docs

### make it good (AKA 'backlog')
- [ ] minimize unnecessary re-rendering
    - [ ] send `ready` from chokidar down the line (and send the number of files â€” or the whole fucking tree with it
- [ ] watch for template partials
- [ ] optimize the `src().write()` case (use plain `cp`)
- [ ] check for sent/expected IDs mismatch (see waiting for templates). use timeouts, I guess.

### put it out
- [ ] publish typings for js-csp
- [ ] write some posts on js-csp
- [ ] publish (and publicize?) the engine
