- [ ] design a chop data structure
    - [x] list of properties needed for collections: slug and all
    - [x] list of properties needed for `dest()`
    - [ ] write down the structure of the data passed down on every step
    - [ ] see if there _is_ a common type to rule them all

# sourceWatcher
- [ ] write tests
    - [ ] use `mock-fs`
